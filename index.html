                <h2>Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi privately discuss Joe Biden's campaign, ‘they want him to….’</h2>
                <h4>Several Congress members and individuals close to Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi feel Biden’s campaign may be nearing its end.</h4>
                <p>Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi privately spoke about President Joe Biden's campaign and expressed concern over his ability to win the 2024 election against Donald Trump. A CNN report claims both former leaders are feeling the pain over the difficulty of Biden’s reelection campaign, yet neither are quite sure about what to do.</p>
                <p>The report further adds that Democrats are eager to end the internal conflicts with many now standing against Biden's decision to continue and refocus on defeating Trump. Many are even urging Obama or Pelosi to intervene, recognizing that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer lacks Biden’s trust and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries lacks a deep relationship with the President.</p>
                <p>“They are watching and waiting for President Biden to reach a decision on his own,” a senior leader within the party told CNN.</p>
                <p>During a high-stakes solo news conference on Thursday at the conclusion of the NATO Summit, Biden said that no poll or person is telling him that he can't win re-election currently. That is the only way he would consider ending his presidential bid.</p>

                <h2>'Congress unleashed dark phase': PM Modi on Samvidhan Hatya Diwas</h2>
                <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday hit out at the Congress after the Centre announced that June 25 every year will be marked as ‘Samvidhan Hatya Diwas’ against the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi-led Congress government in 1975.</p>
                <h3>The 18-month long Emergency was proclaimed during the Congress government led by Indira Gandhi on June 25, 1975.</h3>
                <p>“To observe 25th June as #SamvidhaanHatyaDiwas will serve as a reminder of what happens when the Constitution of India was trampled over. It is also a day to pay homage to each and every person who suffered due to the excesses of the Emergency, a Congress unleashed dark phase of Indian history,” PM Modi posted on social platform X.</p>
                <p>The Emergency row was reignited after the constitution of the 18th Lok Sabha following the 2024 Lok Sabha election results. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla slammed the Emergency in his first address after being elected to the office for a second term.</p>
